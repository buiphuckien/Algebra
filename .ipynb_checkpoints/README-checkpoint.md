This project shows how how to work with matrix in numpy. It contains five jupyter notbook files.

    addRowColumnMatrix.ipynb illustrates how to append a row, a column to matrix. This is a common task when we need to add a bias to a matrix in linear regression.
    
    eigenvaluesOfMatrix.ipynb indicates how to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. This is a regular work in algrbra.
    
    matrixOperations.ipynb displays the basic operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc - to work with matrices.
    
    invertingMatrix.ipynb exhibits how to convert a matrix.
    
    selectingElement.ipynb carry out how to select a row, a column in matrix.
    
These are repeated tasks in algebra and machine learning. Familiar with them save us a lot of time.
